# Pretty-impaired-yet-beautiful-Simple-Banking-System
Welp, that's the first project I've made in Python with a guidance of JetBrains Academy. It definitely is not a masterpiece, but I'm kind of proud of myself because of it. To anyone who will be kind enough to take a look at the code and tell me what could be done better I'd say, that I'm pretty grateful, and thanks for any tips.A very Python 3.x beginner, Vortarin.
